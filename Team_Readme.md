### About Me/ My Job 
My job is to document, maintain, and occasionally build processes for AFSCME's systems such as mobile commons, hustle, action network, targetsmart, and catalist. I see myself as a data engineer - always ensuring that data gets to the data scientists and analysts on my team. This could be anything from ensuring that our Data Warehouse has the most updated and clean data, to building a data pipeline that grabs this data and ships it to another one of our systems, to running a webscraper that ingests additional data to our Warehouse. Sometimes all of this can stress me out, though I try to take it one day at a time and keep from being overwhelmed. 

I take work rather seriously (sometimes to a fault) and have high expectations for myself. One of the largest challenges that comes with this is the difficulty with relaxing or thinking that something is "good enough". I really hate saying that "x works but I don't know why" though I recognize that sometimes satiating my curiousity is not a productive priority. 

### Preferred Communication Method
Usually I prefer meeting in person or over a video chat as I find this is the quickest way to solve problems and includes non-verbal communication. 

I see Slack and email as nearly synonymous and have each on my phone, though generally prefer slack because it tracks conversations better than email. I usually defer to the preferences of my team and the formality of the context when choosing one or the other. 

If a scheduled event of any kind(phone call, in-person, conference) is discussed in a conversation with me, I appreciate calendar invites, because if it's not in my calendar then I'll likely forget about it.

### Personal Intention for Planning Day
I'm looking forward to mapping out our teams' priorities for the next year. My background in the military can leave me craving direction, so I value understanding where to go and what needs done first.

### Personal Principles / Values
I generally assume that most people are working towards a better future politically, professionally, and personally. I find that if someone does something I disagree with, I tend to see it as a disagreement about tactics rather than values. However, if I find that someone has done something I find to be blatantly immoral rather than misguided I will not hesitate to shame that person and avoid them in the future. 

I'm extremely passionate about the goals of the labor movement and as such I can sometimes seem overly serious. In addition to AFSCME, I recently joined the International Workers of the World (IWW) and have plans to join other political organizations once I am no longer in the military.

## Optional Responses

### You: OOO
Outside of work at AFSCME I'm in the Army Reserves as a Civil Affairs Officer. I'm currently seeking discharge from this by way of conscientious objection, though this process has been slow and somewhat draining my excess energy.

When I do have energy, I love exercising by running and spending time in the gym. I was training for a triathalon last fall, though my hope is that this fall post-COVID I'll be able to make those plans a reality. I also love hiking, mountain biking, and enjoyed playing ultimate frisbee with a group in Northern VA prior to COVID. 

I love to read philosophy books, though it seems as though I do a better job of starting them than I do of finishing them. I'm always down to discuss various philosophers or their ideas! I'm passionate about politics and political theory, but also have interests in philosophy of science, philosophy of computer science, ethics, philosophy of mind, and cultural commentary/analysis. I used to love writing in college, though this is a habit that's dwindled over the years to a few specific projects and poems. 

I like playing card and board games with friends and watching movies with my girlfriend Konica. I also play video games - I have a PS4 and play Overwatch consistently and rotate through other single player games when that gets tiring (Horizon Forbidden West, Final Fantasy 7 remake, The Last of Us parts one and 2). I also play minecraft, pokemon, mario kart, and super smash brothers on my switch.

Once the pandemic started I also picked up gardening and playing the guitar. I grew/am growing tomatoes, mint, fennugreek, a bonsai tree, and basil. So far on the guitar I can play a nursery rhyme and "Ode to Joy" by Beethoven. 

### Career Goals

I'm a self-taught programmer, though I would like to get some formal schooling to fill in my many gaps of technical knowledge on the subject. I usually dedicate some time each week to practice coding with datacamp, though I haven't ruled out a graduate degree in computer science or a related program. If it's over 5 years down the road though, I'm really not sure. Academia sounds fun, though a heavier involvement in politics sounds rewarding. 

### Things you should know about me
I generally try to give whatever person or activity I'm doing my full attention, so if I'm nonresponsive or seem less than enthused about shifting gears it's because I have a one track mind and it can be frustrating for me to shift gears or juggle multiple things at once. I also feel like I overshare personal information - though I don't have plans to address this. If you ask me my opinion on something I can be long-winded. I can have a difficult time admitting when I can't do something or figure out a problem, and if I ask for help and you don't immediately have constructive advice for me it's better to tell me that you're unsure and let me continue to chip away at the problem. I take ownership of my work and can even seem defensive if it's taken away from me. 

### Feedback
I appreciate direct, immediate feedback as bluntly as you feel comfortable giving it. However, if I disagree with the assessment or comment I usually don't hesitate to push back. In my experience I've found that I'm usually harder on myself than supervisors are to me. I prefer to give feedback subtly in one-on-one meetings as opposed to groups, though if you outright ask me for blunt feedback I can be rather critical.
